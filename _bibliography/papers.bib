abstract = { Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a challenging task that has been investigated in various domains such as finance investment, health care, traffic, and weather forecasting. In recent years, Linear-based LTSF models showed better performance, pointing out the problem of Transformer-based approaches causing temporal information loss. However, Linear-based approach has also limitations that the model is too simple to comprehensively exploit the characteristics of the dataset. To solve these limitations, we propose LTSF-DNODE, which applies a model based on linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a time series decomposition method according to data statistical characteristics. We show that LTSF-DNODE outperforms the baselines on various real-world datasets. In addition, for each dataset, we explore the impacts of regularization in the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) framework. },

abstract = {Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting --- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.},
