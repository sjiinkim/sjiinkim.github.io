I am a M.S student at [KAIST Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr).

I am now a member of [BigDyl](https://sites.google.com/view/npark/home?authuser=0)(at Daejeon, South Korea), advised by **Noseong Park**. 

My main research interest is **Efficient Language Modeling**, including KV cache and State Space Models, currently emerging foundational models. 
I am also interested in time series analysis and recommendation system.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics and Computer Science at [Yonsei University](https://yonsei.ac.kr), Seoul, Republic of Korea.
